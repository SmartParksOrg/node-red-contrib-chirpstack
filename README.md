# Node-RED Node TypeScript Starter

This is a quick-start template repository for creating new Node-RED node sets in TypeScript.

```

## Getting Started

1. Generate a new GitHub repository by clicking the `Use this template` button at the top of the repository homepage, then clone your new repo. Or you might just clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/alexk111/node-red-node-typescript-starter.git` and cd into it: `cd node-red-node-typescript-starter`.
2. This project is designed to work with `yarn`. If you don't have `yarn` installed, you can install it with `npm install -g yarn`.
3. Install dependencies: `yarn install`.

## Adding Nodes

You can quickly scaffold a new node and add it to the node set. Use the following command to create `my-new-node-type` node:

```
yarn add-node my-new-node-type
```

The node generator is based on mustache templates. At the moment there are two templates available:

- `blank` (used by default) - basic node for Node-RED >=1.0
- `blank-0` - node with a backward compatibility for running on Node-RED <1.0

To generate a node using a template called `my-template`, enter this command:

```
yarn add-node my-new-node-type my-template
```

To make your custom-made template available, add it to `./utils/templates/`.

## Developing Nodes

Build & Test in Watch mode:

```
yarn dev
```

## Building Node Set

Create a production build:

```
yarn build
```

## Testing Node Set in Node-RED

[Read Node-RED docs](https://nodered.org/docs/creating-nodes/first-node#testing-your-node-in-node-red) on how to install the node set into your Node-RED runtime.
